CUSTOMER PURCHASE PREDICTION

In this project, I will build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. I will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information such as age, job, marital status, education, balance, and various other features about the customers. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist marketing efforts by identifying potential customers who are more likely to make a purchase
